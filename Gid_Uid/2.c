The process obtains its own PID and its parentâ€™s PID using the getpid and getppid system
calls. The program also prints the effective UID and GID, which normally are equal to the
real UID and GID. Write a UNIX system program that prints PID, PPID, real and effective
UIDs and GIDs and fetches and sets PATH
